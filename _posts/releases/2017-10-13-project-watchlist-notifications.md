We are pleased to announce the release of a new feature. You can now receive notifications for
projects in your watchlist!

## Who is this for?

Do you want to receive email notifications about comments for a project that you are not directly
involved with? If so then you can receive those notifications by watching the project and enabling
email notifications for the types of events you want to know about.

## How can I receive these notifications?

1. Enable notifications for watch projects

TODO

2. Add the project to your watchlist:

3. Wait for those emails to start arriving
